/**
 * 202. Happy Number
 */
/*

Descriptions:
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

    Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
    Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
    Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: false

 

Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 231 - 1
*/

// Solution
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isHappy = function (n) {
	// floyd’s Cycle Detection - linked list cycle detection
	function getNext(num) {
		let sum = 0;
		while (num > 0) {
			let digit = num % 10;
			sum += digit * digit;
			num = Math.floor(num / 10);
		}
		return sum;
	}

	let slow = n;
	let fast = getNext(n);

	while (fast !== 1 && slow !== fast) {
		slow = getNext(slow);
		fast = getNext(getNext(fast));
	}

	return fast === 1;
};
