/**
 *  268. Missing Number
 */
/*

Descriptions:
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]

Output: 8

Explanation:

n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

*/

// Solution
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var missingNumber = function (nums) {
	const n = nums.length;
	const expectedSum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
	return expectedSum - nums.reduce((a, c) => a + c, 0);
};

// Test Cases
const test = (input, expected) => {
	const actual = missingNumber(input);
	if (actual === expected) console.log('✅Test Passed');
	else console.log('❌Test Failed');
};

test([3, 0, 1], 2);
test([0, 1], 2);
test([9, 6, 4, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 1], 8);
