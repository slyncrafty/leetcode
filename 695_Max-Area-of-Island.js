/**
 *  695. Max Area of Island
 */
/*

Descriptions:
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0

 

Constraints:

    m == grid.length
    n == grid[i].length
    1 <= m, n <= 50
    grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

// Solution
const maxAreaOfIsland = (grid) => {
	const rows = grid.length;
	const cols = grid[0].length;

	const dfs = (r, c) => {
		if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= rows || c >= cols || grid[r][c] === 0) return 0;
		grid[r][c] = 0;
		return 1 + dfs(r - 1, c) + dfs(r, c + 1) + dfs(r + 1, c) + dfs(r, c - 1);
	};

	let maxArea = 0;
	for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
		for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
			if (grid[r][c] === 1) {
				maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, dfs(r, c));
			}
		}
	}
	return maxArea;
};
